# One-tailed f-test II

Hopefully, you are now starting to get bored of this workflow:

As you can see, however, __all__ of these hypothesis tests are essentially just variations on this basic theme.

With that in mind lets thus consolidate what you did in the previous exercise by writing code to test if the NumPy array called `data1` is from a distribution that has a variance that is __greater__ than the variance of the data in the NumPy array called `data2`.  __As you can see from `main.py`, you need to complete the same functions that you completed for the previous exercise with one small variation in order to complete this task.__
